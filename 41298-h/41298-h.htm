 <div class="stanza">
  <span class="i1">So like an arrow swift he flew,</span><br />

 <div class="stanza">
  <span class="i1">The calender, amazed to see</span><br />
  <span class="i2">His neighbour in such trim,</span><br />

  <span class="i1">And broader still became the blaze, and louder still the din,</span><br />

  <span class="i1">Southward, for Surrey's pleasant hills, flew those bright coursers forth;</span><br />
  <span class="i1">High on black Hampstead's swarthy moor, they started for the north;</span><br />
  <span class="i1">And on, and on, without a pause, untired they bounded still;</span><br />
  <span class="i1">All night from tower to tower they sprang, all night from hill to hill;</span><br />
  <span class="i1">Till the proud peak unfurled the flag o'er Derwent's rocky dales;</span><br />
  <span class="i1">Till, like volcanoes, flared to heaven the stormy hills of Wales;</span><br />
  <span class="i1">Till twelve fair counties saw the blaze on Malvern's lonely height;</span><br />
  <span class="i1">Till streamed in crimson, on the wind, the Wrekin's crest of light;</span><br />
  <span class="i1">Till, broad and fierce, the star came forth, on Ely's stately fane,</span><br />
  <span class="i1">And town and hamlet rose in arms, o'er all the boundless plain;</span><br />
  <span class="i1">Till Belvoir's lordly towers the sign to Lincoln sent,</span><br />

 <div class="stanza">
  <span class="i1">Three fishers went sailing out into the west,</span><br />
  <span class="i2">Out into the west, as the sun went down,</span><br />
  <span class="i1">Each thought of the woman who loved him best,</span><br />
  <span class="i2">And the children stood watching them out of the town;</span><br />
  <span class="i1">For men must work, and women must weep,</span><br />
  <span class="i1">And there's little to earn, and many to keep,</span><br />
  <span class="i2">Though the harbour-bar be moaning.</span><br />
 </div>
 <div class="stanza">
  <span class="i1">Three wives sat up in the lighthouse tower,</span><br />
  <span class="i2">And they trimmed the lamps as the sun went down;</span><br />
  <span class="i1">They looked at the squall, and they looked at the shower,</span><br />
  <span class="i2">And the night-rack came rolling up ragged and brown;</span><br />
  <span class="i1">But men must work, and women must weep,</span><br />
  <span class="i1">Though storms be sudden, and waters deep,</span><br />
  <span class="i2">And the harbour-bar be moaning.</span><br />
 </div>
 <div class="stanza">
  <span class="i1">Three corpses lie out on the shining sands,</span><br />
  <span class="i2">In the morning gleam, as the tide goes down,</span><br />
  <span class="i1">And the women are weeping and wringing their hands,</span><br />
  <span class="i2">For those who will never come home to the town.</span><br />
  <span class="i1">For men must work, and women must weep,</span><br />
  <span class="i1">And the sooner it's over, the sooner to sleep,</span><br />
  <span class="i2">And good-bye to the bar and its moaning.</span><br />
